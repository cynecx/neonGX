Changes since the last public release (1.6.17):

Version 1.6.18beta01 [April 1, 2015]
  Removed PNG_SET_CHUNK_[CACHE|MALLOC]_LIMIT_SUPPORTED macros.  They
    have been combined with PNG_SET_USER_LIMITS_SUPPORTED (resolves
    bug report by Andrew Church).
  Fixed rgb_to_gray checks and added tRNS checks to pngvalid.c.  This
    fixes some arithmetic errors that caused some tests to fail on
    some 32-bit platforms (Bug reports by Peter Breitenlohner [i686]
    and Petr Gajdos [i586]).

Version 1.6.18beta02 [April 26, 2015]
  Suppressed some warnings from the Borland C++ 5.5.1/5.82 compiler
    (Bug report by Viktor Szaka'ts).

Version 1.6.18beta03 [May 6, 2015]
  Replaced "unexpected" with an integer (0xabadca11) in pngset.c
    where a long was expected, to avoid a compiler warning when PNG_DEBUG > 1.
  Added contrib/examples/simpleover.c, to demonstrate how to handle
    alpha compositing of multiple images, using the "simplified API"
    and an example PNG generation tool, contrib/examples/genpng.c
    (John Bowler).

Version 1.6.18beta04 [May 9, 2015]
  PNG_RELEASE_BUILD replaces tests where the code depended on the build base
    type and can be defined on the command line, allowing testing in beta
    builds (John Bowler).
  Avoid Coverity issue 80858 (REVERSE NULL) in pngtest.c
